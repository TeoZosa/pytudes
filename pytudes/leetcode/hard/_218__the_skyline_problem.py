def get_skyline(buildings: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:
    """Computes a city's skyline formed by all the buildings in a given city.

    A city's skyline is the outer contour of the silhouette
    formed by all the buildings in that city when viewed from a distance.

    You may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles
    grounded on an absolutely flat surface at height 0.

    Args:
        buildings: locations and heights of all the buildings
            in the form buildings[i] = [left_i, right_i, height_i]
            where:
                left_i: x coordinate of the left edge of the ith building.
                right_i: x coordinate of the right edge of the ith building.
                height_i: height of the ith building.

    Returns: the skyline formed by these buildings collectively.

        Represented as a list of "key points" sorted by their x-coordinate
            in the form [[x1,y1],[x2,y2],...].
        Each key point is the left endpoint of some horizontal segment in the skyline
            EXCEPT the last point in the list,
                which always has a y-coordinate 0
                and is used to mark the skyline's termination where the rightmost building ends.
        Any ground between the leftmost and rightmost buildings should be part of the skyline's contour.

        Constraint(s):
            There must be no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the output skyline.
                For instance, [...,[2 3],[4 5],[7 5],[11 5],[12 7],...] is not acceptable;
                the three lines of height 5 should be merged into one in the final output as such:
                [...,[2 3],[4 5],[12 7],...]
    Examples:
        >>> get_skyline([[2,9,10],[3,7,15],[5,12,12],[15,20,10],[19,24,8]])
        [[2, 10], [3, 15], [7, 12], [12, 0], [15, 10], [20, 8], [24, 0]]
        >>> get_skyline([[0,2,3],[2,5,3]])
        [[0, 3], [5, 0]]
        >>> get_skyline([[1,2,1],[1,2,2],[1,2,3]])
        [[1, 3], [2, 0]]
