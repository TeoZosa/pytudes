# Boggle
## Introduction #
Boggle is a popular word game traditionally played using a plastic grid of lettered dice. Usually, this grid is 4x4 or bigger. During the game, the players take turns finding words that can be constructed from the letters of sequentially adjacent dice. The same letter dice cannot be used more than once. Many variations of this game also exist.

## Statement #
Suppose that you are working for a startup that is creating web applications of traditional board games. They have decided to create a variation of Boggle, and you are assigned to the team responsible for this task. The game can be played in single-player mode, so your team also needs to create a computer player to play against users. Additionally, the game will have multiple modes with varying levels of difficulty.

We need to create two modules that will help the computer player. The first module will be for the easy mode, where only one word needs to be found in the Boggle grid each turn. In the second module, the computer player needs to find the maximum possible words in the Boggle grid from a given set of words. The second module will be used in the difficult mode of the game.

## Features #
We will need to introduce the following features to implement the functionality discussed above:

- Feature #1: For the game’s easy mode, search for a single word in the Boggle grid.

- Feature #2: For the difficult mode, find all possible words that exist in the Boggle grid from a given list of words.

In the coming lessons, we will discuss these features and their solutions in detail, so that you’ll be able to apply the solution to this scenario to different interview problems as well.
