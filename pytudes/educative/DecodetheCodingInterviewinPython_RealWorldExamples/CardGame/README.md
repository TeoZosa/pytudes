# Card Game
## Introduction #
There are countless variations of card games played all around the world, and these games are popular with people of all ages. Card games are played using a deck of playing cards, and a standard deck consists of 52 cards. All of the cards are divided into four suits:

Spade suit ♠️
Club suit ♣️
Hearts suit ♥️
Diamond suit ♦️
There are thirteen cards of each suit, including a 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, a jack, a queen, a king, and an ace. Note that there is no 1.

## Statement #
Suppose you are working for a startup that is creating a web application to play different card game variations. They are planning to design traditional card games like poker as well as introduce their own custom games. All of these games can be played in single-player mode. Therefore, your team also needs to create a computer player to play against users.

Your first task will be to implement a feature that helps the computer player play a variation of poker. We will have to determine if a hand of given cards is a hand of straights or not. For the next feature, we will create a feature for a custom card game called Fizzle. In this feature, the computer player has to find the maximum points that can be obtained by picking out cards from a set of ten revealed random cards.

## Features #
We will need to introduce the following features to implement the functionality discussed above:

- Feature #1: Determine if a hand of straights is possible.

- Feature #2: Find the maximum points that can be obtained from a set of ten random cards.

In the coming lessons, we will discuss these features and their solutions in detail, so that you’ll be able to map the solution to this scenario to different interview problems as well.
