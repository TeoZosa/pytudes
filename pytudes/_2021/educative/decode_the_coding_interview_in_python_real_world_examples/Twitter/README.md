# Twitter
## Introduction #
Twitter is a social media platform on which users post and interact with messages known as “Tweets.” Twitter is also considered a microblogging service because the text of a Tweet can only be up to 280 characters. The users on Twitter can interact with each other by following each other, which allows them to view each other’s Tweets. They can also Retweet, comment, or like other Tweets.

The scenario and the problems discussed in this chapter relate to Twitter’s Tweet management and recommendation system.

## Statement #
Let’s say you are a developer on Twitter’s engineering team. The team has decided to implement APIs that can be exposed to partnered businesses and create modules that can be used for internal workings.

Some of the functionality relates to displaying feeds merged from multiple sources in chronological order. Other functionality relates to analytics and recommendation system.

## Features #
We will need to introduce the following features to implement the functionalities we discussed above:

- Feature #1: Create an API that calculates the total number of likes on a person’s Tweets.

- Feature #2: Implement a module that adds a user’s Tweets into an already populated Twitter feed in chronological order.

- Feature #3: Identify the time periods in which the maximum number of people interact with a user’s Tweets.

- Feature #4: Check if a group of people can be split into two groups such that no one in the same group follows anyone in the same group. Then, we will recommend people from the same group to each other.

Understanding these feature requests and designing their solutions will help us implement the requested functionality into Twitter’s system.

In the next few lessons, we’ll discuss the recommended implementations of these features. Before we start, we suggest that you think about how you would implement these features. You may recognize some of the underlying problems that you’ll need to solve. The solutions to these basic problems are also applicable to other common coding interview questions.
